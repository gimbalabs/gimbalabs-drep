## Rationale for voting "Yes"
The new constitution is “good enough for now, and safe enough to try”. Our yes vote is aligned with the pragmatic approach that has defined Gimbalabs since its founding in 2020: embracing progress over perfection so that we can learn as much as possible and then improve. When we vote to drive experimentation forward, even while recognizing that the constitution is imperfect, we are more likely to create spaces to learn, to explore, and to empower individuals to keep defining and solving problems.

## Dissenting Opinions
1. We acknowledge the potential conflict of interest arising because Gimbalabs is both a member of Intersect and a DRep 
2. We recognize that the 75% approval threshold for constitutional amendments may make it difficult to change the constitution in the future
3. We recognize the need for members of Gimbalabs to be better-informed about Cardano governance
