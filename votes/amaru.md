# Gimbalabs Vote on Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Budget: Amaru Node Development 2025

## Governance Action Id
`gov_action1h4ygjv0hjfj3lmafcm76rpdzcm8vsvj9k5wejn3npyxwxm3fesnqqw9kxxz`

## Rationale for voting "Yes"
Supporting Amaru Node Development aligns with the Gimbalabs mission to provide open, replicable safe spaces to learn and explore in the Cardano ecosystem. The current reliance on a single node implementation creates systemic risk and limits pathways for participation. By voting yes on this proposal, we are voting to diversify Cardano's technical foundation, improve specifications for future node implementations, and enthusiastically demonstrating our commitment to direct on-chain governance using Cardano's native tooling.

We are especially excited to see how Amaru's delivery of "Industry-grade observability" will support educational programming. With improved monitoring, tracing, and logging, we expect to see more opportunities for hands-on learning and experimentation.

We are also voting yes because the Amaru development proposal sets a high standard for future funding requests while addressing a critical need for technical diversity and resilience in the ecosystem. We expect that teams will reference this proposal as a starting point for drafting their own budget requests.

## Dissenting Opinions
1. We recognize that multiple node implementations may increase the complexity of hard fork events
2. We acknowledge that maintaining multiple software implementations requires additional ecosystem resources
3. We understand there are concerns about the timeline and resource allocation for this project
